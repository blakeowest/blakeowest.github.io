      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>Photography is where we start but its not where we end. We will work with you to truly present your seller's home with all the beauty and attention to detail it deserves. We believe a house isn't just another sale, not even just possibly the biggest purchase of the buyer's lifetime, it is a home,  a legacy, a place to be the buyers life's haven to share what means the most to them, all of the little moments with family and friends. This starts with capturing the beauty and value of the house with photography giving your future buyer the first window into their new home. We were founded in 2015 and serve the greater Panama City Beach area providing real estate photography and video. As a young company we are eager to make strong relationships working side-by-side with you to successfully market your home. Strong imagery is such a huge part of our world and has become an essential for growing companies. Let us help you stay on the leading edge in your market.</p>
