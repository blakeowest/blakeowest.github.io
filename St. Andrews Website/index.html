          The Gator Lake Trail and Overlook provide visitors with a beautiful vantage point for spotting alligators and a variety of waterfowl, wading birds and other small animals. At Button Bush Marsh Overlook, a host of birds can be viewed. Herons and ibis feed along the fertile marsh edge as a variety of waterfowl swim and feed in the depths. Throughout the interior of the park you will see raccoon and white tail deer.
